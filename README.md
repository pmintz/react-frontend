# react-frontend

This project is part of a full stack application.  Please run rewards project for the Spring back end.  Once you have cloned the 'rewards' project and have started that application, visit the root of this directory and type in npm start.  Then visit http://localhost:3000/ to begin using the app.  Also, I am not sure why this is the case as all links are working but after clicking on any link throughout the app remember to click on refresh in your browser for the next page to actually appear.
